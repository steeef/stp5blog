# About me

I live in Portland, Oregon, USA. I'm current a Site Reliability Engineer, formerly a Systems Administrator.

I love tinkering with computers to get them to do what I want. I've dabbled in various Raspberry Pi projects, using
Home Assistant to automate my home (or make it more confusing for my family to turn on lights). In my basement, I run a handful of
Debian servers based on small computers I've collected over the years.

When I'm not yelling at my servers, I'm walking my English Cream Retriever, Captain Daisy, playing with my kids, or
dabbling in baking.
